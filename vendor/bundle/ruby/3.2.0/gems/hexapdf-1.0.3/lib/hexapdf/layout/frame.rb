    # A Frame describes the available space for placing boxes and provides additional methods for
    # calculating the needed information for the actual placement.
    #
    # == Usage
    #
    # After a Frame object is initialized, it is ready for fitting boxes in it and drawing them.
    #
    # The explicit way of drawing a box follows these steps:
    #
    # * Call #fit with the box to see if the box can fit into the currently selected region of
    #   available space. If fitting is successful, the box can be drawn using #draw.
    #
    #   The method #fit is also called for absolutely positioned boxes but since these boxes are not
    #   subject to the normal constraints, the provided available width and height are the width and
    #   height inside the frame to the right and top of the bottom-left corner of the box.
    #
    # * If the box didn't fit, call #find_next_region to determine the next region for placing the
    #   box. If a new region was found, start over with #fit. Otherwise the frame has no more space
    #   for placing boxes.
    #
    # * Alternatively to calling #find_next_region it is also possible to call #split. This method
    #   tries to split the box into two so that the first part fits into the current region. If
    #   splitting is successful, the first box can be drawn (Make sure that the second box is
    #   handled correctly). Otherwise, start over with #find_next_region.
    #
    # == Used Box Properties
    #
    # The style properties 'position', 'align', 'valign', 'margin' and 'mask_mode' are taken into
    # account when fitting, splitting or drawing a box. Note that the margin is ignored if a box's
    # side coincides with the frame's original boundary.
    #
    # == Frame Shape
    #
    # A frame's shape is used to determine the available space for laying out boxes.
    #
    # Initially, a frame has a rectangular shape. However, once boxes are added and the frame's
    # available area gets reduced, a frame may have a polygon set consisting of arbitrary
    # rectilinear polygons as shape.
    #
    # It is also possible to provide a different initial shape on initialization.
