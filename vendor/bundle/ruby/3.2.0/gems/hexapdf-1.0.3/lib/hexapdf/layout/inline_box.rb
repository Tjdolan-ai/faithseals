    # An InlineBox wraps a regular Box so that it can be used as an item for a Line. This enables
    # inline graphics.
    #
    # When an inline box gets placed on a line, the method #fit_wrapped_box is called to fit the
    # wrapped box. This allows the wrapped box to correctly set its width and height which are
    # needed by the TextLayouter algorithm.
    #
    # Note: It is *mandatory* that the wrapped box sets its width and height without relying on the
    # dimensions of the frame's current region.
