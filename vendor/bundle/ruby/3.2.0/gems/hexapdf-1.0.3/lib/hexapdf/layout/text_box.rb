module HexaPDF
  module Layout

    # A TextBox is used for drawing text, either inside a rectangular box or by flowing it around
    # objects of a Frame.
    #
    # The standard usage is through the helper methods Document::Layout#text and
    # Document::Layout#formatted_text.
    #
    # This class uses TextLayouter behind the scenes to do the hard work.
    #
    # == Used Box Properties
    #
    # The spacing after the last line can be controlled via the style property +last_line_gap+. Also
    # see TextLayouter#style for other style properties taken into account.
    #
    # == Limitations
    #
    # When setting the style property 'position' to +:flow+, padding and border to the left and
    # right as well as a predefined fixed width are not respected and the result will look wrong.
    #
    # == Examples
    #
    # Showing some text:
    #
    #   #>pdf-composer
    #   composer.box(:text, items: layout.text_fragments("This is some text."))
    #   # Or easier with the provided convenience method
    #   composer.text("This is also some text")
    #
    # It is possible to flow the text around other objects by using the style property
    # 'position' with the value +:flow+:
    #
    #   #>pdf-composer
    #   composer.box(:base, width: 30, height: 30,
    #                style: {margin: 5, position: :float, background_color: "hp-blue-light"})
    #   composer.text("This is some text. " * 20, position: :flow)
    #
    # While top and bottom padding and border can be used with flow positioning, left and right
    # padding and border are not supported and the result will look wrong:
    #
    #   #>pdf-composer
    #   composer.box(:base, width: 30, height: 30,
    #                style: {margin: 5, position: :float, background_color: "hp-blue-light"})
    #   composer.text("This is some text. " * 20, padding: 10, position: :flow,
    #                 text_align: :justify)
