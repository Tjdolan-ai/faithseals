require 'hexapdf/stream'

module HexaPDF
  module Type

    # Represents an XMP metadata stream.
    #
    # XMP metadata streams may be attached to most PDF objects, though it only makes sense for some
    # of them.
    #
    # There is also a main XMP metadata stream for the whole document that is accessible via the
    # /Metadata key of the document catalog. That metadata stream should contain the same values as
    # the PDF's info dictionary and may contain additional entries. This can be accomplished via
    # HexaPDF::Document#metadata.
    #
    # See: PDF2.0 s14.3.2
