  module Layout

    # This is a simple container box for laying out a number of boxes together. It is registered
    # under the :container name.
    #
    # The box does not support the value :flow for the style property position, so the child boxes
    # are laid out in the current region only. Since the boxes should be laid out together, if any
    # box doesn't fit, the whole container doesn't fit. Splitting the container is also not possible
    # for the same reason.
    #
    # By default the child boxes are laid out from top to bottom by default. By appropriately
    # setting the style properties 'mask_mode', 'align' and 'valign', it is possible to lay out the
    # children bottom to top, left to right, or right to left:
    #
    # * The standard top-to-bottom layout:
    #
    #     #>pdf-composer100
    #     composer.container do |container|
    #       container.box(:base, height: 20, style: {background_color: "hp-blue-dark"})
    #       container.box(:base, height: 20, style: {background_color: "hp-blue"})
    #       container.box(:base, height: 20, style: {background_color: "hp-blue-light"})
    #     end
    #
    # * The bottom-to-top layout (using valign = :bottom to fill up from the bottom and mask_mode =
    #   :fill_horizontal to only remove the area to the left and right of the box):
    #
    #     #>pdf-composer100
    #     composer.container do |container|
    #       container.box(:base, height: 20, style: {background_color: "hp-blue-dark",
    #                                                mask_mode: :fill_horizontal, valign: :bottom})
    #       container.box(:base, height: 20, style: {background_color: "hp-blue",
    #                                                mask_mode: :fill_horizontal, valign: :bottom})
    #       container.box(:base, height: 20, style: {background_color: "hp-blue-light",
    #                                                mask_mode: :fill_horizontal, valign: :bottom})
    #     end
    #
    # * The left-to-right layout (using mask_mode = :fill_vertical to fill the area to the top and
    #   bottom of the box):
    #
    #     #>pdf-composer100
    #     composer.container do |container|
    #       container.box(:base, width: 20, style: {background_color: "hp-blue-dark",
    #                                               mask_mode: :fill_vertical})
    #       container.box(:base, width: 20, style: {background_color: "hp-blue",
    #                                               mask_mode: :fill_vertical})
    #       container.box(:base, width: 20, style: {background_color: "hp-blue-light",
    #                                               mask_mode: :fill_vertical})
    #     end
    #
    # * The right-to-left layout (using align = :right to fill up from the right and mask_mode =
    #   :fill_vertical to fill the area to the top and bottom of the box):
    #
    #     #>pdf-composer100
    #     composer.container do |container|
    #       container.box(:base, width: 20, style: {background_color: "hp-blue-dark",
    #                                               mask_mode: :fill_vertical, align: :right})
    #       container.box(:base, width: 20, style: {background_color: "hp-blue",
    #                                               mask_mode: :fill_vertical, align: :right})
    #       container.box(:base, width: 20, style: {background_color: "hp-blue-light",
    #                                               mask_mode: :fill_vertical, align: :right})
