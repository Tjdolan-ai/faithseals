    # The base class for all layout boxes.
    #
    # == Box Model
    #
    # HexaPDF uses the following box model:
    #
    # * Each box can specify a width and height. Padding and border are inside, the margin outside
    #   of this rectangle.
    #
    # * The #content_width and #content_height accessors can be used to get the width and height of
    #   the content box without padding and the border.
    #
    # * If width or height is set to zero, they are determined automatically during layouting.
    #
    #
    # == Subclasses
    #
    # Each subclass should only take keyword arguments on initialization so that the boxes can be
    # instantiated from the common convenience method HexaPDF::Document::Layout#box. To use this
    # facility subclasses need to be registered with the configuration option 'layout.boxes.map'.
    #
    # The methods #supports_position_flow?, #empty?, #fit_content, #split_content, and #draw_content
    # need to be customized according to the subclass's use case (also see the documentation of the
    # methods besides the information below):
    #
    # #supports_position_flow?::
    #     If the subclass supports the value :flow of the 'position' style property, this method
    #     needs to be overridden to return +true+.
    #
    #     Additionally, if a box object uses flow positioning, #fit_result.x should be set to the
    #     correct value since Frame#fit can't determine this and uses Frame#left in the absence of a
    #     set value.
    #
    # #empty?::
    #     This method should return +true+ if the subclass won't draw anything when #draw is called.
    #
    # #fit_content::
    #     This method determines whether the box fits into the available region and should set the
    #     status of #fit_result appropriately.
    #
    #     It is called from the #fit method which should not be overridden in most cases. The
    #     default implementations of both methods provide code common to all use-cases and delegates
    #     the specifics to the subclass-specific #fit_content method.
    #
    # #split_content::
    #     This method is called from #split which handles the common cases based on the status of
    #     the #fit_result. It needs to handle the case when only some part of the box fits. The
    #     method #create_split_box should be used for getting a basic cloned box.
    #
    # #draw_content::
    #     This method draws the box specific content and is called from #draw which already handles
    #     things like drawing the border and background. So #draw should usually not be overridden.
    #
    # This base class also provides various protected helper methods for use in the above methods:
    #
    # * #reserved_width, #reserved_height
    # * #reserved_width_left, #reserved_width_right, #reserved_height_top,
    #   #reserved_height_bottom
    # * #update_content_width, #update_content_height
    # * #create_split_box
