  module FontLoader

    # This module translates font names like 'Helvetica bold' into the arguments 'Helvetica' and
    # {variant: :bold}.
    #
    # This eases the usage of font names where specifying a font variant is not straight-forward.
    # The actual loading of the font is deferred to Document::Fonts#add.
    #
    # Note that this should be the last entry in the list of font loaders to ensure correct
    # operation.
    module VariantFromName

      # Returns a font wrapper for the given font by splitting the font name into the font name part
      # and variant selector part. If the the resulting font cannot be resolved, +nil+ is returned.
      #
      # A font name should have the form 'Fontname selector' where selector can be 'bold', 'italic'
      # or 'bold_italic', for example 'Helvetica bold'.
      #
      # Note that a supplied :variant keyword argument is ignored!
